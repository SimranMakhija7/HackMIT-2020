## About CodeCapture

**CodeCapture** is a cross-platform app that aims to assist remote learning experiences in Computer Science for students without computers by taking code from paper to mobile. CodeCapture has the functionality to extract code (C++, Java, JavaScript, or Python) from images of handwritten text and then allow the user to edit, compile, and share the result via email/SMS. We also have various lessons on C++ (more languages coming soon) to assist with students' Computer Science education especially in times like these, where the COVID-19 pandemic and enforced lockdown have kept students away from school.

## Inspiration

While in recent times, the world has started moving towards pro-CS education, the fact is that buying computers is a distant dream for most students and educational institutions across the globe even today. In most developing countries, the ratio of CS students versus the number of computers available is highly skewed and most students are still learning programming via pen-and-paper. At the same time, however, the number of people who own mobile phones has significantly increased. Bridging this gap between pen-and-paper coding and coding on a computer by using a technology that people already own can bring a significant difference in the adoption of Computer Science education today.

## Technologies Used

* Application: Xamarin.Forms (C#, XAML, .NET)
* Extracting Code: Azure Computer Vision (Read API)
* Compiling Code: JDoodle Compiler API
* Result SMS: Twilio Programmable SMS

## Future Plans

We do have various plans for the future, such as:
1.    Gamifying the progress for users
2.    Support for more languages
3.    Lessons on more technologies
4.    A web-based learning platform designed for educators
